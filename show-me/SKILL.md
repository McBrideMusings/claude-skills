description: Show a compact visual instead of a wall of prose when explaining logic, control flow, UI structure, a refactor, or a diff in an ordinary chat reply — pseudocode, a call tree, a component tree, a shallow file tree, a Mermaid diagram, or a scoped diff. Use whenever a normal answer is about to describe a shape in paragraphs instead of drawing it.
---

Help the user understand the current topic of conversation visually, inline in chat. Skip the preamble and keep prose brief. Pick the smallest view that makes the key point clear — this is the lightweight, always-available sibling of `explain`, for the routine case of *any* answer, not a dedicated explainer file.

- Show logic or an algorithm as pseudocode:

```text
on(save)
  if content is unchanged
    return cached result
  write new content
  return fresh result
```

- Show runtime control flow as a call tree:

```text
submitForm
  createSession
    persistPrompt
    launchAgent
  navigateToSession
```

- Show UI structure as a component tree, including state and module boundaries that matter:

```tsx
<SessionPage> (apps/example/src/routes/session.tsx)
  useSessionEvents()
  <SessionToolbar>
    <RunSkillButton> (packages/ui)
```

- Show file responsibility or a broad refactor as a shallow file tree:

```text
src/
├── commands/       # parses user actions
├── sessions/       # owns session state
└── transport/      # sends API requests
```

- Show component interaction, control flow, or data flow with Mermaid:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Daemon
    User->>UI: choose command
    UI->>Daemon: send expanded prompt
    Daemon-->>UI: stream result
```

- Use `diff` when the point is what changes and the surrounding shape already exists. Match the diff shape to the topic.

For a component change:

```diff
 <SessionPage>
   useSessionEvents()
   <SessionToolbar>
+    <RunSkillButton />
   <SessionTimeline>
+    <SkillResultCard />
```

For a file-layout change:

```diff
 src/
 ├── commands/
+│   └── show-me.ts       # expands the slash command
 ├── sessions/
-└── transport.ts
+└── transport/
+    ├── client.ts
+    └── stream.ts
```

For a call-tree or call-stack change:

```diff
 submitForm
   createSession
     persistPrompt
+    expandSkillMention
     launchAgent
-  navigateToSession
+  navigateToSession
+    subscribeToEvents
```

For a state or control-flow change:

```diff
 on(save)
-  write content
+  if content is unchanged
+    return cached result
+  write new content
+  invalidate cache
```

- Show the whole block when most of it is new, when omitted context would hide ownership or order, or when the user needs a copyable target shape:

```ts
function expandSkill(command: string): string {
  const skillName = command.slice(1)
  return `use the ${skillName} skill`
}
```

- For a visual UI, layout, state comparison, or concept too dense for any of the above — reach for `explain` instead. That skill owns the hermetic HTML artifact; don't build one here.

- Place each visual next to the short text it supports. Keep only the calls, files, props, states, and boundaries needed to answer the user's current question.

You may use one of these, you may use several, it is unlikely you will use all of them in one reply. Use your judgement and don't overwhelm the user.

## When NOT to use

- The topic earns a standalone, keepable artifact (a UI/layout comparison, a multi-layered concept, something the user will return to) → `explain`.
- The point is what's worth reading in a large diff, not how to visualize one piece of it → `meat`.
